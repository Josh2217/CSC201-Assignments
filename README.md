# CSC201-Assignments
Literally just my solutions to the CSC201 Assignments

I will post one well written and well commented solution for every assignment I recieve this semester, and then most likely I will be posting some obfuscated code golf solutions as well.

You can run the batch files in the `.build` directory to run the code for each assignment, or if you are more comfortable in the terminal you can do your own thing with the source code. 

I'm inclined to say this falls under the widly loved license: WTFPL. Do whatever you want, but I will say one thing...

__**Plagiarism is bad**__: please don't steal these solutions and try to pass them off as your own. If you do and I find out, I'll be very sad and will have to private this repo. If you're inspired to use "similar methods" as I did, I don't care. That being said, please don't copy me verbatim because as I stated earlier, plagiarism is bad.

*Because the above clause was not listened to, readable source code will be .gitignored-ed until after the assignment is due.*

Thanks
