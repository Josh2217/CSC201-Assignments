# Assignment 4

Ask the user to enter the size of an array (int value)

Allocate a 2D array of int that size (if the user enters in 5, then allocate a 5x5 array)

Using a Random, initialize each element of the array to be either 0 or 1

Output the array in a table format

Output the fraction of your array that is ones and the fraction that is zeros. For example, suppose the user asked for a 3x3 array and after initialization that array happened to contain 4 ones and 5 zeros.  The fraction of ones would be 4/9 and the fraction of zeros would be 5/9. 

Calculate and output the sum of each row. Output the index of the largest row sum.

Calculate and output the sum of each column. Output the index of the largest column sum.

Out “rows win” if the largest row sum is greater than the largest column sum. Otherwise, output “columns win”

Calculate the diagonal sum. Use the diagonal starting at location \[0\]\[0\] and going down to \[N-1\]\[N-1\] for an array of size N.

Output “diagonals rule” if the diagonal sum is greater or equal to the largest row sum and greater than or equal to the largest column sum.

Below are three example runs.
