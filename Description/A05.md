# Requirements

Create a java class named "MyRectangle2D.java"

Your class will have double two variables named x and y. These represent the center of your rectangle.

Your class will have two double variables named width and height. These will represent the width and height of your rectangle.

Create getter and setter methods for x, y, width, and height.

Create a "no argument" constructor for your class that sets x and y to 0, and width and height to 1. Have this constructor output your first and last name. 

Create a constructor for your class that has x, y, width, and height input parameters.

* If the x or y input parameters are less than 0.0 set them to be 0.0

* If the width or height input parameters are less than 1.0 set them to 1.0

Create method `myTop()` that returns the y coordinate of the top of the rectangle 

Create method `myBottom()` that returns the y coordinate of the bottom of the rectangle

Create method `myLeft()` and `myRight()`... it's obvious what these do contextually

Create method `getArea()`... more obvious stuff

Create method `getPerimeter()`

Create method `contains(double inx, double iny)` that returns true if the point (inx, iny) lies within the rectangle
